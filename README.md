Web Design for Everybody / Capstone / University of Michigan / Coursera
Mobile First Portfolio Using Bootstrap

Layout: 
The topic I chose to cover in my web design is outlining the three main front-end coding 
languages: HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, and touching on three popular frameworks: 
Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS and Foundation.
In addition to coding from scratch, I used the Bootstrap framework.

My site titled CODEMODE has three main pages with navbar access: 
1. Front-End Developer
2. Big 3
3. Frameworks.
   
Big 3 has a dropdown menu for sub-pages:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
   
Extras used:
1. JavaScript to send text content back to the DOM via a submit button
2. JavaScript for form validation
3. JavaScript for popup messages
4. Bootstrap Cards
5. Bootstrap Accordion
6. Bootstrap Navbar
7. Bootstrap Toast Button
8. Media Queries for breakpoints
9. Bootstrap Gird
10. Font Awesome Icons
    
CSS:
In addition to the standard CSS rules applied to classes and IDs, I used animation and
pseudo-classes:
1. hover
2. placeholder
   
JAVASCRIPT:
Form validation for joining a mailing list:
1. Gathered references to DOM elements and stored them in CONST variables.
2. Used If & Else conditional statements to validate user input.
3. Sent text content back to the DOM with alert messages based on what the user 
entered in the input fields. 
4. Reset and clear the form upon successful validation with an alert message.

A popup message is delivered to the DOM via a Bootstrap Toast Trigger after clicking a
button in the navbar.
